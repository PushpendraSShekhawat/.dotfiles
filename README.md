# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
  My .vimrc file adds some customization to my shell. From what I have seen so far, all of the color has been taken away from my vim.
## .bashrc
  My .bashrc file created multiple functions that can be used inside of my terminal. Very similarly to my .vimrc file, all of my color has been taken away as well.
